## Overview

This 2-day workshop covers how to analyze large amounts of data in R.  We will focus on scaling up our analyses using the same dplyr verbs that we use in our everyday work. We will use dplyr with data.table, databases, and Spark.  We will also cover best practices on visualizing, modeling, and sharing against these data sources.  Where applicable, we will review recommended connection settings, security best practices, and deployment options.

### Learning objectives

In this 2-day workshop, attendees will learn how to connect to and analyze large scale data

### Is this course for me?

You should take this workshop if you want to learn how to work with big data in R. This data can be in-memory, in databases (like SQL Server), or in a cluster (like Spark).

## Prework

### Helpful reading

Some have asked for material that would be useful to review prior to the class.  The following is a compilation of subjects would be great if you are familiar with already by the time the class begins, but it is not a requirement that you study or review them. 

* Data Transformation - http://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html
* Relational Data - http://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html
* Data visualization - http://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html

For database background, please review the articles in the following links:

* Database Best Practices - http://db.rstudio.com/best-practices/
* Databases using dplyr - http://db.rstudio.com/dplyr/

For spark background, please review the following:

* sparklyrâ€™s website home page: http://spark.rstudio.com/
* Using dplyr with sparklyr: http://spark.rstudio.com/dplyr/
* Machine Learning: http://spark.rstudio.com/mlib/
* Deployment options: http://spark.rstudio.com/deployment/

## Equipment

**We plan to provide a personal server to each student for use during the class.**  The server will contain all of the applications and materials needed, including R and RStudio.  **All you will need is a laptop with a web browser.**  For those of you that need to use their work provided laptops for the class, please ensure that the web browser in it will not be prevented from navigating to Amazon AWS, which is where the servers will be set up.
