# Introduction to `vroom`

## `vroom` basics
*Load data into R using `vroom`*

1. Load the `vroom()` library
    ```{r, eval = eval_vroom}
    library(vroom)
    ```

2. Use the `vroom()` function to read the **transactions_1.csv** file from the **/usr/share/class/files** folder
    ```{r, eval = eval_vroom}
    vroom("/usr/share/class/files/transactions_1.csv")
    ```

3. Use the `id` argument to add the file name to the data frame.  Use **file_name** as the argument's value
    ```{r, eval = eval_vroom}
    paths = "/usr/share/class/files/transactions_1.csv"
    vroom(paths, id = "file_name") # adding filename as column identifier.
    ```

4. Load the prior command into a variable called `vr_transactions`
    ```{r, eval = eval_vroom}
    vr_transactions = vroom(paths, id = "file_name")
    ```

5. Load the file spec into a variable called `vr_spec`, using the `spec()` command
    ```{r, eval = eval_vroom}
    vr_spec <- spec(vr_transactions)
    vr_spec
    ```

## Load multiple files

1. Load the `fs` and `dplyr` libraries
    ```{r, eval = eval_vroom}
    library(fs) # file system manipulation package consistent with linux/unix.
    library(dplyr)
    ```

2. List files in the **/usr/share/class/files** folder using the `dir_ls()` function
    ```{r, eval = eval_vroom}
    dir_ls("/usr/share/class/files") # you can be more creative with file search.
    ```

3. In the `dir_ls()` function, use the `glob` argument to pass a wildcard to list CSV files only. Load to a variable named `files`
    ```{r, eval = eval_vroom}
    paths = "/usr/share/class/files"
    files = dir_ls(path = paths, glob = "*.csv") # taking multiple files and 
    ```

4. Pass the `files` variable to `vroom`. Set the `n_max` argument to 1,000 to limit the data load for now

    ```{r, eval = eval_vroom}
    vroom(files, n_max = 1000, id = "file_name_yea") # call filename whatever you want
    ```

5. Add a `col_types` argument with `vr_specs` as its value
    ```{r, eval = eval_vroom}
    vroom(files, n_max = 1000, id = "file_name", col_types = vr_spec)
    # using previously defined `vr_spec` to be the column identification.
    ```

6. Use the `col_select` argument to pass a `list` object containing the following variables: order_id, date, customer_name, and price
    ```{r, eval = eval_vroom}
   
    vroom(files, n_max = 1000, id = "file_name", col_types = vr_spec, 
          col_select = list("order_id", "customer_name", "price")) 
    # interestingly, can't specify character strings
    ```

## Load and modify multiple files
*For files that are too large to have in memory, keep a summarization*

1. Use a `for()` loop to print the content of each vector inside `files`
    ```{r, eval = eval_vroom}
    for(i in seq_along(files)) {
      print(files[i])
    }
    ```

2. Switch the `print()` command with the `vroom` command, using the same arguments, except the file name.  Use the `files` variable.  Load the results into a variable called `transactions`. 
    ```{r, eval = eval_vroom}
    
    # right now, I am realizing that vroom is working with this for loop
    for(i in seq_along(files)) {
      transactions <- vroom(files[i], n_max = 1000, col_types = vr_spec, 
          col_select = list("order_id", "customer_name", "price")) 
    }
    transactions
    ```

3. Group `transactions` by `order_id` and get the total of `price` and the number of records. Name them `total_sales` and `no_items` respectively. Name the new variable `orders`
    ```{r, eval = eval_vroom}
    
for(i in seq_along(files)) {
  transactions <- vroom(files[i], n_max = 1000, col_types = vr_spec, 
                       col_select = list(order_id, date, customer_name, price))
  orders <- transactions %>%
    group_by(order_id) %>%
    summarise(total_sales = sum(price), no_items = n())
 
}
    
    orders
    ```

4. Define the `orders` variable as `NULL` prior to the for loop and add a `bind_rows()` step to `orders` to preserve each summarized view.
    ```{r, eval = eval_vroom}
    orders <- NULL
for(i in seq_along(files)) {
  transactions <- vroom(files[i], n_max = 1000, col_types = vr_spec, 
                       col_select = list(order_id, date, customer_name, price))
  orders <- transactions %>%
    group_by(order_id) %>%
    summarise(total_sales = sum(price), no_items = n()) %>% 
    bind_rows(orders) # retaining the summary and binding them
}
    
    orders
    

    ```
    
5. Remove the `transactions` variable at the end of each cycle    
    ```{r, eval = eval_vroom}
    orders <- NULL
for(i in seq_along(files)) {
  transactions <- vroom(files[i], n_max = 1000, col_types = vr_spec, 
                       col_select = list(order_id, date, customer_name, price))
  orders <- transactions %>%
    group_by(order_id) %>%
    summarise(total_sales = sum(price), no_items = n()) %>% 
    bind_rows(orders) # retaining the summary and binding them
  rm(transactions)
}
    
    orders
    ```
    
6. Preview the `orders` variable
    ```{r, eval = eval_vroom}
    # if file_name was kept, you cna make sure that there are no diplicate instances of filenames
    ## orders %>%
    ##   count(order_id, file_name) %>% 
    ##   ungroup() %>% 
    ##   count(n)
    head(orders)
    ```
